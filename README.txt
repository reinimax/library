This should become a "library" where the user can view, add and remove books.

Local storage is now implemented and the code executes fine also when local storage is not available.
Now it is time to prettify the thing with CSS.
Also: when local storage is not available, it would be cool to disable the "delete storage"-button.
Also a message should be displayed on the page in a <p>-tag that informs the user about the storage.
