This project is a "library" where the user can view, add and remove books.

Local storage is now implemented and the code executes fine also when local storage is not available.
For now, it looks good enough, though its looks could be improved (fix remove button to the bottom of the card, or make it into an icon and fix it to the bottom right of the card; add a button that shows/hides the div with the input-fields ...). Also, in the future this page could warrant a deeper look into accessibility/user experience. Do I and how do I want to put focus on elements? Should I make the fields mandatory? For now, I leave it as it is.
